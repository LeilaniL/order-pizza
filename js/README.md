# Pizza Ordering Website
#### by Leilani Leach

## Description

This is a simple form to order pizza and see the cost of your order. It was made to practice using constructors, objects, and prototypes for an Epicodus independent project.

## Specs

* A form records user selections for pizza size and toppings
* Each pizza is saved as an object with attributes for size and toppings
* The size and type of toppings change the final cost
* The pizza price is returned to the user and displayed on the page
* The total order cost updates as users add more pizzas

## Languages and Libraries Used
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

## Known Bugs
* If a user clicks "Add pizza" without selecting any inputs, a total price of $5 will still display
* There isn't a way to delete/remove a pizza, or see details of pizzas once added
